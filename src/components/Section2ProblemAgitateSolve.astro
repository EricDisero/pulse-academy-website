                    You've got the musical ideas, spent thousands on industry-standard plugins, booked professional studio time. Your producer friends love your tracks. Your mom thinks you're the next big thing.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    But then you A/B test your song against your reference tracks and your heart sinks.

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    There's that indefinable quality, that professional polish, that radio-ready punch, that major-label sheen, that your tracks just don't have. <strong class="text-red-400">And you have no idea what specific technical elements you're missing.</strong>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">The five words that destroy music careers. You've heard them from A&R reps at major labels, Spotify playlist curators, Apple Music editors, and distribution platform scouts. They're the difference between bedroom hobby and professional career, and you can't figure out what "there" actually means in technical terms.</p>
