        question: "Will this work for my genre?",
        answer: "While we specialize in electronic music, pop, and hip-hop, the approach works for any genre. The principles of professional production are universal."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need special plugins?",
        answer: "Not at all. Our methods work with any DAW and standard plugins. It\'s about techniques, not specific tools."
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from other courses?",
        answer: "Instead of subjective tips, we show you exactly what makes professional tracks work at the stem level. We focus on measurements, not opinions."
    },
    {
        question: "I\'ve tried everything. Why would this be different?",
        answer: "That\'s why the free session exists – experience it yourself with your own music, then decide."
    },
    {
        question: "How advanced do I need to be?",
        answer: "You should know your way around your DAW, but you don\'t need to be advanced – just committed to improving."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I\'m short on time?",
        answer: "Our approach actually saves time by eliminating guesswork. Many of our students tell us they achieved more in weeks than they did in years of trial and error."
