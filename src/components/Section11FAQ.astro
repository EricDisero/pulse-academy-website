    {
        question: "Is this really free? What's the catch?",
        answer: "Yes, it's completely free. No hidden costs, no upsells during the session. I offer this because I know once you see how powerful this approach is, you'll want to work with us. It's that simple."
    },
    {
        question: "Will this work for my genre?",
        answer: "While we specialize in electronic music, pop, and hip-hop, the approach works for any genre. Professional mixing principles are universal, whether you're making trap, house, rock, or country."
    },
    {
        question: "I've tried everything. Why would this be different?",
        answer: "Because this isn't about tips or tricks, it's about data. We'll show you the exact frequency response, dynamics, and spatial characteristics of professional tracks vs. yours. No guesswork, just measurable differences you can fix."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need expensive plugins or gear?",
        answer: "Not at all. Our methods work with any DAW and standard plugins that come with it. It's about understanding what to do, not what tools to buy. Better techniques beat expensive gear every time."
    },
    {
        question: "What if my track is terrible?",
        answer: "Perfect! The worse your starting point, the more dramatic your improvement will be. We've worked with complete beginners and helped them achieve professional results. Your current level doesn't matter, your willingness to improve does."
    },
    {
        question: "How advanced do I need to be?",
        answer: "You should know your way around your DAW and be able to create complete tracks, but you don't need to be advanced. If you can make a beat and add some vocals or leads, you're ready."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm short on time?",
        answer: "This actually saves you time. Instead of spending months guessing what's wrong, you'll know exactly what to fix in 30 minutes. Many students tell us they achieved more in weeks than they did in years of trial and error."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after the free session?",
        answer: "Nothing unless you want it to. You'll get your analysis, action plan, and reference stems with no obligation. If you want ongoing help, we'll tell you about our program, but there's zero pressure."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you really improve any track?",
        answer: "If it's mixed and arranged reasonably well, absolutely. We've taken amateur-sounding tracks and helped them reach label-quality standards. The key is knowing exactly what needs to change, which is what we show you."
